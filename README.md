# Guessing_Game Competition Game

Motivation

The motivation behind creating this Guessing Competition Game was to provide a fun and interactive experience for users to test their guessing skills. Games like this can be entertaining and challenging, giving users a chance to engage their minds while trying to guess the correct number.

The game's simplicity and straightforward rules make it accessible to a wide audience, including beginners and experienced developers. It serves as a small project that can be used to practice coding skills, logic, and random number generation in C#.

Additionally, the humorous responses and positive reinforcement for correct guesses add an element of enjoyment to the game. Even if players do not guess correctly on their first attempt, they are encouraged to try again, fostering perseverance and determination.

Creating such games and small projects can be an excellent way for developers to explore new concepts, experiment with programming techniques, and build confidence in their coding abilities. Moreover, it can be a source of enjoyment for users who get to play and challenge themselves in a light-hearted and engaging manner.

By sharing this project on GitHub, we hope to inspire other developers to explore the creative side of coding and encourage them to create their own fun and interactive programs. The code is open-source, allowing others to learn from it, suggest improvements, and even contribute to the project.

Remember, coding is not just about solving complex problems; it's also about having fun, being creative, and sharing your passion for programming with others. Happy coding and guessing!

How to Play


Run the program to start the game. The program will display a welcome message.

You will be asked if you want to participate in the guessing competition:

Enter 1 for "Yes" if you want to play.
Enter 2 for "No" if you do not want to play.
If you choose to play (1), you will be eligible for the game. If you choose not to play (2), you will receive a humorous message.

The game allows you three chances to guess the correct number.

The program will randomly generate a number between 1 and 50 for you to guess.

Enter your guess for the number.

If your guess matches the generated number, you win the game, and the program will display "Congratulations! You win."

If your guess is incorrect, the program will display "Wrong! You have Failed" and give you another attempt.

You have three attempts to guess the correct number. After each incorrect guess, the program will display the number of chances remaining.

The game ends after three attempts or if you correctly guess the number.
